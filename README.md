## How to use it?

ðŸ”ž If you want to give it a try, fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don't want or need. You should not blindly use my settings. Use at your own risk! ðŸ˜ˆ

Run the `configure.ps1` script in a powershell with admin rights. The script can be run multiple times, if something is already installed it will be updated to the latest version.
